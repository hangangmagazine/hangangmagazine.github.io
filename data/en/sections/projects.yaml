  summary: |
    Han Gang Magazine is a data reporting blog about Korea. A personal passion project to deliver contextual insights into Korea for expats, utilizing SEO best practices. Built in Wordpress.

    I targeted Korea-related topics I am personally interested and which I assessed were not well-covered. I was able to displace many Korea blogs, newspapers, and travel sites for my targeted keywords.

    I also practiced my data skills - data wrangling, cleaning, R vis, reporting. See [here](https://hangangmagazine.com/category/briefs) for my reports.
